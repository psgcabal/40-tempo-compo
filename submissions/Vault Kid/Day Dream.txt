Made with LSDJ 5.7.4 + my custom Drumkit I use for every of my songs
Briefly mastered in Ableton

All Channels have a 3/3 groove (so I kind of worked at 80 BPM but with less ticks).
The song went very repetitive but I guess it's okay-ish for scope of the challenge.

Thing I disliked the most:
It's very difficult at 40 BPM + 3/3 groove to hide that drums and bass are playing both in the wav channel. (But maybe I was just crap at hiding it :D )

Thing I liked the most:
I never worked with 40 BPM and so few ticks in LSDJ, so I had to experiment a lot. :)
