## Explainations:

I did what any person with a little experience in LSDJ would do:

Since the tempo is set to 40, unless you wanna make something really slow,
you can't really do anything substantial with it. So what did I do?
I changed the groove! Instead of it being 6/6, it changes between 3/1
and 1/1.

I managed to make a pretty decent kick overall. I did have to keep in mind that changing the note of the kick would either make it have a beep in the end or make it not-a-kick.
